# AI-Driven Patient Classification for Efficient Specialist Referral System

This project aims to build an AI-based system that classifies patients based on routine blood test results and recommends appropriate medical specialists for referral. The goal is to support quicker, data-driven triage and improve patient outcomes in line with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being).

## üî¨ Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were developed and evaluated on the dataset:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Deep Neural Network (DNN using Keras)
- TabNet (using PyTorch TabNet)

Models were compared based on metrics such as **precision**, **accuracy**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrices**, with a focus on **precision** due to the clinical importance of reducing false positives.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Project
